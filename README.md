Welcome to Early Alzheimers! This website includes a fun game that also serves as an early detection test for Alzheimers. It has multiple different parts to it, such as memory, writing, and everyday object recognition. First, you are given a set of directions which a set of direction, which you enter in as part of memory. Then, you are asked to write down a recipe as the writing part of the game. Finally, you are given pictures of objects and have to enter the amounts of each object needed from the recipe that you wrote down. You are given a score, and advised on how you did. Also in this website is the MoCA test, which is printable, along with a video guide on how to take it. For the sake of this website, I encourage you to submit your score as data I can use to test the productivity of this website.
